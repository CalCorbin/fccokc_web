Thank you everyone for taking some time to give us feedback on the survey. We really value all of your insights and comments so that we can make this group a better resource for you. In case you missed it, you can still get to it here: [https://fccokc.com/survey](https://fccokc.com/survey). Here's a short summary of some of our findings, for those who are interested.

## Reasons for Not Attending

I wanted to start by addressing the most important question (in my opinion), which are the reasons for not attending meetups or being involved with the group.

To those who feel that meetups are intimidating, don't feel like you know enough or belong, or don't know anyone: I totally understand that feeling. When I attended my first meetup at this group in 2017, I felt very intimidated as I didn't know anyone there, had no clue about web development, and am generally quite introverted. I had to take a step out of my comfort zone to attend, but I am very glad I did as I've met some amazing people and have since volunteered to help organize the group to give back to the community that helped me get started.

I'd like to remind everyone that our group is here to help folks get started. We are here to help, even if you have yet to write your first line or code or have no idea how to get started⁠—that's what we're here for!

We will try to be better about about sending news about the group via email like this, given that email was by far our biggest response. Just a reminder that if you have [the Meetup app](https://www.meetup.com/apps/) on your phone, you can get notifications for any new meetups we schedule automatically.

## Meetup Formats

With regards to meetup formats, responses seem to be quite even across the board except for slightly less interest in panels. As we no longer have access to Starspace46, we are looking for a new speaker venue and will continue having them virtually on Twitch in the meantime. We will start to re-introduce in-person meetups for coffee and code style meetups soon once we find good locations to do so. [Let us know](/contact) if you have any suggestions on locations!

We recently gave the space at the [Deep Fork Technology](https://www.deepforktechnology.com/) office a try, which was good for smaller groups and quieter conversation, and we plan to give other local spots a try in the coming months, so keep an eye out for them! Some Starbucks and other coffee shops do not yet have indoor seating available, so we are on the lookout for locations where it would be ideal to bring your laptop and have WiFi.

With the transition back to more in-person meetups, we face a new challenge with them being limited only to the metro area where I and the other co-organizers are located. If you live outside the metro area and have ideas on organizing a local event in your area, we'd love to chat with you about it!

## Meetup Topics

Next up is meetup topics. Front-end development, back-end development, and Python all tied for first place, with soft skills/career development just slightly behind them.

These are vast areas in the industry and there are many topics to go into for each of them. Some of these might include:

- Front-end Development
    - Fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - JavaScript Frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
    - UX Design
    - Accessibility
- Back-end Development
    - APIs
    - Databases / SQL
    - GraphQL
- Python
    - Data Science
    - Machine Learning

If you have any specific topics would you like to see in these categories, whether specific frameworks, languages, tools, etc., [let us know](/contact) and we will try to find a speaker or have a code along session for them.

## Final Remarks

Much of this year and last have been a challenge for many of us, and I appreciate all the help from my fellow co-organizers, volunteers, and our many speakers to keep the group running.

We appreciate all of our attendees for coming to our events and making our community a great one. I can't wait to see where the rest of 2021 will take our group.
