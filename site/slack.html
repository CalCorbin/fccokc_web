<h1>What is Slack?</h1>

<p>Here's how you join Slack.</p>
<p>
    Slack is an instant messaging and collaboration system on steroids. You can download the program on Slack's
    <a href="https://slack.com/" title="Slack.com">website</a>. Also, you can access Slack channels you have joined
    through the web browser. In order to access the Techlahoma Slack, you must create an account separate from any other
    Slack accounts you might already have, which you can request at
    <a href="http://slack.techlahoma.org/" title="Techlahoma Slack Invite">http://slack.techlahoma.org/</a>. After
    creating an account, you can access the Techlahoma Slack by visiting
    <a href="https://techlahoma.slack.com/" title="Techlahoma Slack">https://techlahoma.slack.com/</a>.
